## Running locally

### Telegram API Token
  Before you start, please visit official [Telegram documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather) for instructions on how to obtain Telegram API token


### Telegram test environment
You can test and develop your MiniApps in Telegram test environment, which is completely separate from the main environment.
For that you'll have to create new separate account and a bot with @BotFather.
Don't forget to set environment variable `DEV=true` in `server/.env` to perform API calls to test environment as well.

### Ngrok
As telegram only allows to open MiniApps available from the internet, we'll need to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to expose our app outside.
Follow [official docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to install and authenticate ngrok. Then run the following command to start tunnel:

```
  ngrok http 3000 # your server port
```

If you want to launch the app in DEV mode, you'll need to make ngrok instatiate several tunnels at once. For that purpose create ngrok [config](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/reference/config/) with the following content:

```
authtoken: yourTokenHere
tunnels:
  first:
    addr: 5173 # server port
    proto: http    
  second:
    addr: 3000 # client dev server port
    proto: http
```

Once cofig file is created/updated, start ngrok with the following command:
```
ngrok start --all
```

### Build
Follow the instructions on how to start/build project in corresponding webapp and server README files.
